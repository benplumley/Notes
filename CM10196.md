**Propositional Calculus**  
A proposition, or statement, is either true or false. This is known as its *truth value*. Propositions are represented as letters, like variables in algebra.

*Conjuction* is the propositional connective equivalent to logical *AND*. It is defined as follows:  
$$x$$|$$y$$|$$x \land y$$  
-|-|:-----:  
0|0|0  
0|1|0  
1|0|0  
1|1|1  

*Disjunction* is equivalent to logical *OR*.
