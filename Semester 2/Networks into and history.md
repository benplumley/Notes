###Networks History

The "Internet" (capital I) is the world-wide collection of networks. An "internet" (lowercase i) is an abbreviaton of "internetwork", which is just some collection of networks. An "intranet" is some collection of networks belonging to a single organisation. *The Web is not the Internet*.

The internet started as a project by the American Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in response to the Russians launching Sputnik (the first sattelite) during the Cold War. The idea was to connect the Agency's expensive resources, namely their computers, allowing them to be shared. The design was to be non-centralised to avaoid single points of failure, particularly nuclear attacks, so it was designed to have multiple paths between hosts.

Using simple circuits between machines would be too vulnerable, so *packet switching* was invented. Data is chopped into small chunks (i.e. packets), and each packet is sent individually, possible over different paths. The original data is then reconstructed at the receiving host.

This causes a few problems though. How is the data split? How are the routes found? How do we reconstruct the data from the packets? A packet doesn't know how to get to it's destination, and neither does the source host (unless it's on a local network). A packet is like a postcard with the address written on it, it relies on the *routers* it passes through to make the right decision.

To ensure maximum interoperability, the internet relies on standars and defined protocols. The use of standards means that two machines will be able to communicate with eachother, even if they are made my completely different companies, are of completely different techonologies, and have never previously interacted.
