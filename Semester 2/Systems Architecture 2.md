#Systems Architecture 2
##Dr Russel Bradford

An operating system is a program (often called the kernel) which:
- Manages the resources of the computer e.g. CPU, memory, keyboard, and any software that controls it.
- Provides the programmer with a usable programming interface to access those resources
The interface that the end user interacts with is just another program that uses the OS, *not* a part of the OS.

There are 3 main reasons for managing resources:
- **They are limited** - There is not always enough resources to go round, e.g. mobile phones have strict limtations on memory,
CPU power and energy consumption.
- **Protection** -
