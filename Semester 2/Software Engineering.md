#CM10193 - Software Engineering
##Dr Leon Watts and Dr Fabio Nemetz

A **system** is a purposeful composition of parts, i.e. multiple components working together as a single entity, e.g. a car as a collection of moving mechanical components, or an animal as a set of living biological parts.

System properties: 
- Robustness, maintainability, usability
- Result from component relationships e.g dependencies between code modules.
- Dynamic performance of overall system

**Subsystems** are components of larger systems that *can* operate independently, but *don't* operate independently when incorporated into larger systems, e.g. a GPS in a car navigation system.

A **Software System** is a set of software components in technical and social environments. Components 'take charge' of sets of operations and responsibilities and interact through interfaces. Properties of a good software system include:
- Actually delivering the required function
- Usable - must make sense to the user it was defined for and fit with the demands of their work
- Maintainable - must evolve to meet changing needs
- Dependable - must be trustworthy
- Efficient - should not be wasteful of system resources

The complex relationships between the components in a system mean that a system is more than simply the sum of its parts. It has properties that are properties of the system as a whole and cannot be attributed to any specific part of the system, known as **emergent properties**.

**Software Processes** are a defined set of activities and associated results that produce a software product. There are several different models e.g. waterfall. Activities common to all software processes are:
- Software specification
- Software design and implementation
- Software 'validation'
- Software evolution

Some key challenges faced in software engineering are:
- **Heterogeneity Challenge** - Building dependable software to cope with the heterogeneity (diversity) of existing computer systems, support structures, and legacy software.
- **Delivery Challenge** - Shortening delivery times for complex systems without compromising on quality.
- **Trust Challenge** - To develop techniques that demonstrate software can be trusted by its users.

**Technical computer-based systems** include both hardware and software. The operators and operational prcesses are not normally considered to be part of the system. They are not self-aware.

**Socio-technical systems** *include* technical systems, as well as the operational proccesses and the people who use and interact with the technical system. They are non-deterministic, and governed by organisational policy.

**Project Scheduling** involves estimating the time and resources required to complete activites and organise them into a coherent sequence. The project should be broken down into distinct tasks, with an estimated duration. Contingencies should be allowed for.

A **Gantt Chart** is used to represent the structure of the team's work, showing the tasks the project has been broken down into over time. It is designed to allow planning and monitoring of tasks. It gives a clear impression of task timing, clearly showing what needs to be done and when and any concurrencies. However, it is not so effective in showing dependencies and personnel responsibilities.
