##Dr Leon Watts and Dr Fabio Nemetz

A **system** is a purposeful composition of parts, i.e. multiple components working together as a single entity, e.g. a car as a collection of moving mechanical components, or an animal as a set of living biological parts.

System properties:
- Robustness, maintainability, usability
- Result from component relationships e.g dependencies between code modules.
- Dynamic performance of overall system

**Subsystems** are components of larger systems that *can* operate independently, but *don't* operate independently when incorporated into larger systems, e.g. a GPS in a car navigation system.

A **Software System** is a set of software components in technical and social environments. Components 'take charge' of sets of operations and responsibilities and interact through interfaces. Properties of a good software system include:
- Actually delivering the required function
- Usable - must make sense to the user it was defined for and fit with the demands of their work
- Maintainable - must evolve to meet changing needs
- Dependable - must be trustworthy
- Efficient - should not be wasteful of system resources

**Software Processes** are a defined set of activities and
