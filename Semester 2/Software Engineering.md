###Software Systems

A **system** is a purposeful composition of parts, i.e. multiple components working together as a single entity, e.g. a car as a collection of moving mechanical components, or an animal as a set of living biological parts.

System properties: 
- Robustness, maintainability, usability
- Result from component relationships e.g dependencies between code modules.
- Dynamic performance of overall system

**Subsystems** are components of larger systems that *can* operate independently, but *don't* operate independently when incorporated into larger systems, e.g. a GPS in a car navigation system.

A **Software System** is a set of software components in technical and social environments. Components 'take charge' of sets of operations and responsibilities and interact through interfaces. Properties of a good software system include:
- Actually delivering the required function
- Usable - must make sense to the user it was defined for and fit with the demands of their work
- Maintainable - must evolve to meet changing needs
- Dependable - must be trustworthy
- Efficient - should not be wasteful of system resources

The complex relationships between the components in a system mean that a system is more than simply the sum of its parts. It has properties that are properties of the system as a whole and cannot be attributed to any specific part of the system, known as **emergent properties**.

**Software Processes** are a defined set of activities and associated results that produce a software product. There are several different models e.g. waterfall. Activities common to all software processes are:
- Software specification
- Software design and implementation
- Software 'validation'
- Software evolution

Some key challenges faced in software engineering are:
- **Heterogeneity Challenge** - Building dependable software to cope with the heterogeneity (diversity) of existing computer systems, support structures, and legacy software.
- **Delivery Challenge** - Shortening delivery times for complex systems without compromising on quality.
- **Trust Challenge** - To develop techniques that demonstrate software can be trusted by its users.

**Technical computer-based systems** include both hardware and software. The operators and operational prcesses are not normally considered to be part of the system. They are not self-aware.

**Socio-technical systems** *include* technical systems, as well as the operational proccesses and the people who use and interact with the technical system. They are non-deterministic, and governed by organisational policy.

**Project Scheduling** involves estimating the time and resources required to complete activites and organise them into a coherent sequence. The project should be broken down into distinct tasks, with an estimated duration. Contingencies should be allowed for.

A **Gantt Chart** is used to represent the structure of the team's work, showing the tasks the project has been broken down into over time. It is designed to allow planning and monitoring of tasks. It gives a clear impression of task timing, clearly showing what needs to be done and when and any concurrencies. However, it is not so effective in showing dependencies and personnel responsibilities.

###Ethics and Professional Conduct

**Codes of conduct** are set by professional bodies or institutions, and are necessary to maintain professionalism. They are typically a set of principles that are meant to guide rather than prescribe. Therefore they are often ambiguous in application and must be used in aid to professional judgement in ethical dilemmas.

An example of ethics in the real world is the US Challenger space shuttle disaster in 1986. There were problems with the O-rings in relation to cold launch conditions, which was noted by an engineer. However, no testing was done due to more pressing problems. The engineers all unanimously recommended against the launch, however Space Centre was "surprised and appalled" at the recommendation, and went ahead with the launch due to political and financial pressures. The O-rings failed and the shuttle exploded 73 seconds into the mission, killing all seven crew.

There are 8 main principles in the **ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics**. These are:

1. Public - Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
2. Client and Employer - Act in the best interests of their client and employer, consistent with the puiblic interest.
3. Product - Products and related modifications shall meet the highest professional standards possible.
4. Judgement - Integrity and independence in their professional judgement.
5. Management - Adopt and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
6. Profession - Advance the integrity and reputation of the profession, consisten with the public interest.
7. Colleagues - Be fair and supportive of other colleagues.
8. Self - Software engineers shall adopt both a "lifelong learning" and ethical approach to the practice of their profession.

There are many potential difficulties with codes of conduct. They can be ambiguous, parts of it may conflict, and you may find yourself in situations which are not covered by the code, in which case you are expected to behave professionally and use your best judgement. Codes of conduct are also subject to continual development.

The **B.C.S. Code of Conduct** (revised 2011) is as follows:

1. **Public Interest**. This takes into account public health, privacy, security and well-being of others and the environment. It also covers legitimate rights of third parties, and discrimination on grounds of sex, sexual orientation, maital status, nationality, colour, race, ethnic origin, religion, age or disability.
2. **Professional Competence and Integrity**. Do not claim to be competent when you know you are not. Develop your professional knowledge and skills (lifelong learning). Respect and value alternative viewpoints. Reject bribery.
3. **Duty to relevant authority**. Respect confidentiality of information unless the law requires disclosure. Avoid conflict of interest between work and relevant authorities.
4. **Duty to Profession** Uphold the reputation of the profession. Encourage and support fellow members in thier professional development.
