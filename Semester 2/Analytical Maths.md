**Determinant**  
The determinant is a number associated with a matrix. For a 2 by 2 matrix, it is calculated by subtracting the product of the trailing diagonal from the product of the leading diagonal.

**Cramer's Rule**  
Replacing the nth column of a matrix with the result vector and dividing the determinant of that matrix by the determinant of the original matrix gives a solution for the nth variable. Repeating this for all variables gives a solution to the system.

**Non-singularity**
A square matrix A is called non-singular if there exists an inverse matrix A^-1 such that A*A^-1 is equal to the identity matrix. A system of equations AX = b can be solved by premulitplying both sides by A^-1.
