Databases not only store data, but also provide functionality through stored procedures. They also act like servers in that clients which access them can run on any platform and be written in any language.

There are risks with using databases, however.
- Crackers can sabotage the data or steal it. This can be prevented with backups, honest staff, secure and up-to-date software, logging and testing.
- The database or any part of the stack can fail. This can be prevented by using a reliable stack and having redundancy in components and systems.
- The laws regarding data storage can change. This can be dealt with by monitoring legislation and joining associations.
- The company can outgrow its data storage systems. This can be prevented by proper handling of concurrent requests and easily scalable design.
